<hl>
A small module for Foundry VTT, which in its initial stage, just helps GMs to avoid revealing their maps by automatically canceling the dragged tokens' movement animation, when there is a wall in their path.

There are also settings for removing by default the movement animation from all tokens, or changing the default movement speed.

If the setting for no token movement animations is selected, you can provide scene uuids or scene ids, for specific scenes to be excluded.
